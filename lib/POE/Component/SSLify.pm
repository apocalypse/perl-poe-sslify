	# BinGOs did an awesome job building various versions of openssl to try and track down the problem, it seems like
	# newer versions of openssl worked fine on netbsd, but I don't want to do crazy stuff like probing openssl versions
	# as it's fragile - best to let the user figure it out :)

=func Client_SSLify

This function sslifies a client-side socket. You can pass several options to it:

	my $socket = shift;
	$socket = Client_SSLify( $socket, $version, $options, $ctx, $callback );
		$socket is the non-ssl socket you got from somewhere ( required )
		$version is the SSL version you want to use
		$options is the SSL options you want to use
		$ctx is the custom SSL context you want to use
		$callback is the callback hook on success/failure of sslification

		# This is an example of the callback and you should pass it as Client_SSLify( $socket, ... , \&callback );
		sub callback {
			my( $socket, $status, $errval ) = @_;
			# $socket is the original sslified socket in case you need to play with it
			# $status is either 1 or 0; with 1 signifying success and 0 failure
			# $errval will be defined if $status == 0; it's the numeric SSL error code
			# check http://www.openssl.org/docs/ssl/SSL_get_error.html for the possible error values ( and import them from Net::SSLeay! )

			# The return value from the callback is discarded
		}

If $ctx is defined, SSLify will ignore $version and $options. Otherwise, it will be created from the $version and
$options parameters. If all of them are undefined, it will follow the defaults in L</SSLify_ContextCreate>.

BEWARE: If you passed in a CTX, SSLify will do Net::SSLeay::CTX_free( $ctx ) when the
socket is destroyed. This means you cannot reuse contexts!

NOTE: The way to have a client socket with proper certificates set up is:

	my $socket = shift;	# get the socket from somewhere
	my $ctx = SSLify_ContextCreate( 'server.key', 'server.crt' );
	$socket = Client_SSLify( $socket, undef, undef, $ctx );

NOTE: You can pass the callback anywhere in the arguments, we'll figure it out for you! If you want to call a POE event, please look
into the postback/callback stuff in L<POE::Session>.

	# we got this from POE::Wheel::SocketFactory
	sub event_SuccessEvent {
		my $socket = $_[ARG0];
		$socket = Client_SSLify( $socket, $_[SESSION]->callback( 'sslify_result' ) );

	# If an error occurs blocking will return undef and $! will be set.

=func Server_SSLify

This function sslifies a server-side socket. You can pass several options to it:

	my $socket = shift;
	$socket = Server_SSLify( $socket, $ctx, $callback );
		$socket is the non-ssl socket you got from somewhere ( required )
		$ctx is the custom SSL context you want to use; overrides the global ctx set in SSLify_Options
		$callback is the callback hook on success/failure of sslification

BEWARE: L</SSLify_Options> must be called first if you aren't passing a $ctx. If you want to set some options per-connection, do this:

	my $socket = shift;	# get the socket from somewhere
	my $ctx = SSLify_ContextCreate();
	# set various options on $ctx as desired
	$socket = Server_SSLify( $socket, $ctx );

NOTE: You can use L</SSLify_GetCTX> to modify the global, and avoid doing this on every connection if the
options are the same...

Please look at L</Client_SSLify> for more details on the callback hook.

=func SSLify_ContextCreate

Accepts some options, and returns a brand-new Net::SSLeay context object ( $ctx )

	my $ctx = SSLify_ContextCreate( $key, $cert, $version, $options );
		$key is the certificate key file
		$cert is the certificate file
		$version is the SSL version to use
		$options is the SSL options to use

You can then call various Net::SSLeay methods on the context

	my $mode = Net::SSLeay::CTX_get_mode( $ctx );

By default we don't use the SSL key + certificate files

By default we use the version: default. Known versions of the SSL connection - look at
L<http://www.openssl.org/docs/ssl/SSL_CTX_new.html> for more info.

	* sslv3
	* tlsv1

Call this function to initialize the global server-side context object. This will be the default context whenever you call
L</Server_SSLify> without passing a custom context to it.

	SSLify_Options( $key, $cert, $version, $options );
		$key is the certificate key file ( required )

=func SSLify_GetCTX

Returns the actual Net::SSLeay context object in case you wanted to play with it :)

If passed in a socket, it will return that socket's $ctx instead of the global.

	my $ctx = SSLify_GetCTX();			# get the one set via SSLify_Options
	my $ctx = SSLify_GetCTX( $sslified_sock );	# get the one in the object

}

=func SSLify_GetCipher

Returns the cipher used by the SSLified socket

	print "SSL Cipher is: " . SSLify_GetCipher( $sslified_sock ) . "\n";

NOTE: Doing this immediately after Client_SSLify or Server_SSLify will result in "(NONE)" because the SSL handshake
is not done yet. The socket is nonblocking, so you will have to wait a little bit for it to get ready.

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This component represents the standard way to do SSL in POE.

=head1 NOTES

=head2 Socket methods doesn't work

The new socket this module gives you actually is tied socket magic, so you cannot do stuff like
getpeername() or getsockname(). The only way to do it is to use L</SSLify_GetSocket> and then operate on
the socket it returns.

=head2 Dying everywhere...

This module will die() if Net::SSLeay could not be loaded or it is not the version we want. So, it is recommended
that you check for errors and not use SSL, like so:

	eval { use POE::Component::SSLify };
	if ( $@ ) {
		$sslavailable = 0;
	} else {
		$sslavailable = 1;
	}

	# Make socket SSL!
	if ( $sslavailable ) {
		eval { $socket = POE::Component::SSLify::Client_SSLify( $socket ) };
		if ( $@ ) {
			# Unable to SSLify the socket...
		}
	}

=head3 $IGNORE_SSL_ERRORS

As of SSLify v1.003 you can override this variable to temporarily ignore some SSL errors. This is useful if you are doing crazy things
with the underlying Net::SSLeay stuff and don't want to die. However, it won't ignore all errors as some is still considered fatal.
Here's an example:

	{
		local $POE::Component::SSLify::IGNORE_SSL_ERRORS=1;
		my $ctx = SSLify_CreateContext(...);
		#Some more stuff
	}

=head2 OpenSSL functions

Theoretically you can do anything that Net::SSLeay exports from the OpenSSL libs on the socket. However, I have not tested every
possible function against SSLify, so use them carefully!

=head3 Net::SSLeay::renegotiate

This function has been tested ( it's in C<t/2_renegotiate.t> ) but it doesn't work on FreeBSD! I tracked it down to this security advisory:
L<http://security.freebsd.org/advisories/FreeBSD-SA-09:15.ssl.asc> which explains it in detail. The test will skip this function
if it detects that you're on a broken system. However, if you have the updated OpenSSL library that fixes this you can use it.

NOTE: Calling this means the callback function you passed in L</Client_SSLify> or L</Server_SSLify> will not fire! If you need this
please let me know and we can come up with a way to make it work.

=head2 Upgrading a non-ssl socket to SSL

You can have a normal plaintext socket, and convert it to SSL anytime. Just keep in mind that the client and the server must agree to sslify
at the same time, or they will be waiting on each other forever! See C<t/3_upgrade.t> for an example of how this works.

=head2 Downgrading a SSL socket to non-ssl

As of now this is unsupported. If you need this feature please let us know and we'll work on it together!

=head2 MSWin32 is not supported

This module doesn't work on MSWin32 platforms at all ( XP, Vista, 7, etc ) because of some weird underlying fd issues. Since I'm not a windows
developer, I'm unable to fix this. However, it seems like Cygwin on MSWin32 works just fine! Please help me fix this if you can, thanks!

=head2 SSL ENGINEs

OpenSSL supports loading ENGINEs to accelerate the crypto algorithms. SSLify v1.004 automatically loaded the engines, but there was some
problems on certain platforms that caused coredumps. A big shout-out to BinGOs and CPANTesters for catching this! It's now disabled in v1.007
and you would need to explicitly enable it.

	sub POE::Component::SSLify::LOAD_SSL_ENGINES () { 1 }
	use POE::Component::SSLify qw( Client::SSLify );

=head1 EXPORT

Stuffs all of the functions in @EXPORT_OK so you have to request them directly.

=head1 ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS

	Original code is entirely Rocco Caputo ( Creator of POE ) -> I simply
	packaged up the code into something everyone could use and accepted the burden
	of maintaining it :)

	From the PoCo::Client::HTTP code =]
	# This code should probably become a POE::Kernel method,
    	# seeing as it's rather baroque and potentially useful in a number
    	# of places.

ASCENT also helped a lot with the nonblocking mode, without his hard work this
module would still be stuck in the stone age :)

A lot of people helped add various features/functions - please look at the changelog for more detail.
