=func Client_SSLify

	Accepts a socket, returns a brand new socket SSLified. Optionally accepts SSL
	context data.
		my $socket = shift;						# get the socket from somewhere
		$socket = Client_SSLify( $socket );				# the default
		$socket = Client_SSLify( $socket, $version, $options );		# sets more options for the context
		$socket = Client_SSLify( $socket, undef, undef, $ctx );		# pass in a custom context

	If $ctx is defined, SSLify will ignore other args. If $ctx isn't defined, SSLify
	will create it from the $version + $options parameters.

	Known versions:
		* sslv2
		* sslv3
		* tlsv1
		* default

	By default we use the version: default

	By default we don't set any options

	NOTE: The way to have a client socket with proper certificates set up is:
		my $socket = shift;	# get the socket from somewhere
		my $ctx = SSLify_ContextCreate( 'server.key', 'server.crt' );
		$socket = Client_SSLify( $socket, undef, undef, $ctx );

	BEWARE: If you passed in a CTX, SSLify will do Net::SSLeay::CTX_free( $ctx ) when the
	socket is destroyed. This means you cannot reuse contexts!

		my $socket = shift;	# get the socket from somewhere
		my $ctx = SSLify_ContextCreate();
		# set various options on $ctx as desired

=func SSLify_ContextCreate

		my $mode = Net::SSLeay::CTX_get_mode( $ctx );

=func SSLify_GetCTX

	Returns the actual Net::SSLeay context object in case you wanted to play with it :)

	If passed in a socket, it will return that socket's $ctx instead of the global.
		my $ctx = SSLify_GetCTX();			# get the one set via SSLify_Options

=func SSLify_GetCipher

	Returns the cipher used by the SSLified socket

	Example:
		print "SSL Cipher is: " . SSLify_GetCipher( $sslified_sock ) . "\n";

	NOTE: Doing this immediately after Client_SSLify or Server_SSLify will result in "(NONE)" because the SSL handshake
	is not done yet. The socket is nonblocking, so you will have to wait a little bit for it to get ready.

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This component represents the standard way to do SSL in POE.

=head1 NOTES

=head2 Socket methods doesn't work

The new socket this module gives you actually is some tied socket magic, so you cannot do stuff like
getpeername() or getsockname(). The only way to do it is to use L</SSLify_GetSocket> and then operate on
the socket it returns.

=head2 Dying everywhere...

This module will die() if Net::SSLeay could not be loaded or it is not the version we want. So, it is recommended
that you check for errors and not use SSL, like so:

	eval { use POE::Component::SSLify };
	if ( $@ ) {
		$sslavailable = 0;
	} else {
		$sslavailable = 1;
	}

	# Make socket SSL!
	if ( $sslavailable ) {
		eval { $socket = POE::Component::SSLify::Client_SSLify( $socket ) };
		if ( $@ ) {
			# Unable to SSLify the socket...
		}
	}

=head3 $IGNORE_SSL_ERRORS

As of SSLify v1.003 you can override this variable to temporarily ignore some SSL errors. This is useful if you are doing crazy things
with the underlying Net::SSLeay stuff and don't want to die. However, it won't ignore all errors as some is still considered fatal.
Here's an example:

	{
		local $POE::Component::SSLify::IGNORE_SSL_ERRORS=1;
		my $ctx = SSLify_CreateContext(...);
		#Some more stuff
	}

=head2 OpenSSL functions

Theoretically you can do anything that Net::SSLeay exports from the OpenSSL libs on the socket. However, I have not tested every
possible function against SSLify, so use them carefully!

=head3 Net::SSLeay::renegotiate

This function has been tested ( it's in C<t/2_renegotiate.t> ) but it doesn't work on FreeBSD! I tracked it down to this security advisory:
L<http://security.freebsd.org/advisories/FreeBSD-SA-09:15.ssl.asc> which explains it in detail. The test will skip this function
if it detects that you're on a broken system. However, if you have the updated OpenSSL library that fixes this you can use it.

=head2 In-Situ sslification

You can have a normal plaintext socket, and convert it to SSL anytime. Just keep in mind that the client and the server must agree to sslify
at the same time, or they will be waiting on each other forever! See C<t/3_insitu.t> for an example of how this works.

=head2 MSWin32 is not supported

This module doesn't work on MSWin32 platforms at all ( XP, Vista, 7, etc ) because of some weird underlying fd issues. Since I'm not a windows
developer, I'm unable to fix this. However, it seems like Cygwin on MSWin32 works just fine! Please help me fix this if you can, thanks!

=head1 EXPORT

	Stuffs all of the above functions in @EXPORT_OK so you have to request them directly

=head1 SEE ALSO
POE
Net::SSLeay

=head1 ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS

	Original code is entirely Rocco Caputo ( Creator of POE ) -> I simply
	packaged up the code into something everyone could use and accepted the burden
	of maintaining it :)

	From the PoCo::Client::HTTP code =]
	# This code should probably become a POE::Kernel method,
    	# seeing as it's rather baroque and potentially useful in a number
    	# of places.

ASCENT also helped a lot with the nonblocking mode, without his hard work this
module would still be stuck in the stone age :)
