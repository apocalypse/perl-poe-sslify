 - Bazerka@irc noticed that POE wasn't even listed as a runtime prereq,
   d0h!

1.007 2011-05-04T21:36:32Z UTC
 - Revert the ENGINE load logic added in 1.004 because it was causing
   coredumps on netbsd ( thanks BINGOS! )
 - Add the constant LOAD_SSL_ENGINES sub if you need to load the ssl
   engines
 - Tweak the renegotiate tests to be more tolerant of failures, thanks
   RCAPUTO - RT#66741

1.006 2011-04-22T00:21:51Z UTC
 - Fix a heinous bug where openssl will randomly+reliably close a
   connection ( thanks MIRE )
 - Tweak the hook tests so they test the case where no data is sent over
   the connection
 - Tweak the connfail tests so they work better

1.005 2011-03-10T07:55:30Z UTC
 - Fix the connfail tests due to an incorrect assumption regards socket
   close value, thanks CPANTesters!

1.004 2011-03-08T23:39:03Z UTC
 - We now load certificate files via CTX_use_certificate_chain_file(),
   thanks Zephaniah E. Loss-Cutler-Hull <warp-spam_perl@aehallh.com>
   OpenSSL docs suggest it -
   http://www.openssl.org/docs/ssl/SSL_CTX_use_certificate.html#NOTES
   PLEASE yell at me if you need the old functionality - the docs suggest
   this is the "better" way to do it...
 - Add the ability to pass a subref to call on connection/negotiation
   success, thanks Zephaniah E. Loss-Cutler-Hull
   <warp-spam_perl@aehallh.com> NOTE: This will not work if you do
   renegotiation or any other zany SSL stuff!
 - Add the SSLify_GetStatus function to get the status of the connection
 - After staring at the Net::SSLeay/OpenSSL docs for a while I realized we
   were missing support for sslv23 version, added!
 - After some investigation, we now load all default ENGINEs for OpenSSL on
   startup, as it might provide a performance boost

1.003 2011-02-28T15:52:24Z UTC
 - Add $IGNORE_SSL_ERRORS to ignore certain SSL errors, thanks MNUNBERG -
   RT#66130

   behavior on MSWin32

   instead
