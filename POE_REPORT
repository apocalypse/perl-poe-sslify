Hello,

	I was playing with the SSLify testsuite in an attempt to improve it and stumbled on something totally
unexpected! The t/simple_parallel_superbig.t test sends a ~3MB packet via Server/Client::TCP and Filter::Line.
I rushed out SSLify with that test but I did notice that it took a while to run (~180s on my beefy box!) and
it made me feel that something was fishy.

	So I brought out the big guns and ran NYTProf on the test.

  apoc@box:~/eclipse_ws/perl-poe-sslify$ PERL_MM_USE_DEFAULT=1 AUTOMATED_TESTING=1 NYTPROF=blocks=1:calls=2 perl -d:NYTProf t/simple_superbig.t

	Here's the NYTProf output:

  XXXLINKNYTPROF_LINEXXX

	Thanks to NYTProf, the slowdown was *somewhere* in POE::Filter::Line. I immediately jumped to the
conclusion that POE::Filter::Line was not really suited for my purposes and decided to re-run the test with
POE::Filter::Block utilizing BlockSize => length($str). The results was surprising!

XXXLINKNYTPROF_BLOCKXXX

	For starters, the runtime went from 183s to 3s in my crude testing! The difference was just too great
for me to let Filter::Line lose to Filter::Block! I dug deeper into the source for Filter::Line and based
on the NYTProf diagnostics it was THIS line taking up 180s out of the total runtime of 183s. Line 155 is:

unless $self->[FRAMING_BUFFER] =~ s/^(.*?)$self->[INPUT_REGEXP]//s;

	You'll note that it's a super-backtracking regex that when confronted with a 3MB string will take
exponential time trying to match the INPUT_REGEXP! I remember hitting weird regex bugs in the past which looked
like this and then the answer dawned on me. The solution is to simply avoid doing the costly backtracking unless
necessary. Here's the oneliner patch :)

# Insert before lines 154/155
last LINE unless $self->[FRAMING_BUFFER] =~ $self->[INPUT_REGEXP];

	The runtime went from 183s to 11.5s which is a speed-up of almost 16x! It's not reaching the 3s that
Filter::Block was able to achieve, but I doubt I can speed it up more without calling in the regex wizards :)

	With grep.cpan.me I can see ~130 dists using POE::Filter::Line so I hope this will have a meaningful
impact for some of them. Oh, this patch passes the testsuite ;)
